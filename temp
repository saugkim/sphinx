This strategy uses ideas from http://lucasbardella.com/report/hosting-your-sphinx-docs-in-github/, which uses a separate directory for docs and keeps the autogenerated stuff out of the main repo. This in contrast to suggestions on http://pages.github.com/, which does stuff within the repo directory. Using a separate docs dir made things easier for me to figure out and configure easier with the Sphinx makefile.

See http://daler.github.com/sphinxdoc-test for the Sphinx-generated version of this README, created using the commands documented in it...

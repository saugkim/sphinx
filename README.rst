github allows the publishing of static pages associated with a particular repository (called project pages), which you can read more about at http://pages.github.com/,

I frequently use Sphinx (http://sphinx.pocoo.org/) for documenting projects, and would like to have my docs for a repo published to the gh-pages for that repo.

This strategy uses ideas from http://lucasbardella.com/report/hosting-your-sphinx-docs-in-github/, which uses a separate directory for docs and keeps the autogenerated stuff out of the main repo. This in contrast to suggestions on http://pages.github.com/, which does stuff within the repo directory. Using a separate docs dir made things easier for me to figure out and configure easier with the Sphinx makefile.

See http://daler.github.com/sphinxdoc-test for the Sphinx-generated version of this README, created using the commands documented in it...
